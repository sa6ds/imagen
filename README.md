Imagen is a web application that harnesses the power of the ControlNet Replicate API to enable users to input prompts and sketch images on a canvas. The web app then sends a request to the API, which generates a AI-generated image based on the input. Users can not only view their recent sketches but also explore a gallery of images generated by the community.

## Features

- **Prompt Input:** Users can enter a prompt or description for the AI to generate images based on their input. The [bad-words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bad-words") library was used to filter out any inappopriate prompts. 
- **Canvas Sketching:** The web app utlizes [ReactSketchCanvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sketch-canvas) to provide users the ability to sketch their desired image.
- **Replicate API Integration:** Imagen utilizes the [ControlNet Scribble API](https://replicate.com/jagilley/controlnet-scribble/api) to generate a collection of AI-generated images based on the user's prompt and sketch.

- **Community Gallery:** Imagen also allows users to explore and browse through a gallery of AI-generated images contributed by the community.


- **Firebase Authentication:** Users are required to log in before generating images, ensuring secure access and tracking of generations.

- **Three-Strike System:** A system has been implemented to deactivate user accounts after three attempts to make inappropriate generations, promoting responsible use.

- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Users can easily undo, redo, and clear the canvas using keyboard shortcuts, enhancing the user experience.


## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** The frontend of Imagen is built using Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. TypeScript is used for type safety and better development experience. Tailwind CSS is employed for styling the user interface.

- **Backend:** The backend of Imagen is powered by Convex, a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that simplifies server-side operations. Convex integrates with the ControlNet Replicate API to handle requests for generating AI-generated images.

- **Authentication:** Firebase is used for user authentication, providing secure login functionality.

- **Deployment:** Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, is used for deploying Imagen. It provides a seamless deployment experience and ensures scalability and reliability.
